ABSTRACT:

Wireless communication developments are creating new sensor capabilities. The current developments in the field of sensor networks are critical for environmental
applications. Internet of Things (IoT) allows connections among various devices with the ability to exchange and gather data. IoT also extends its capability to
environmental issues in addition to automation industry by using industry 4.0. As water is one of the basic needs of human survival, it is required to incorporate
some mechanism to monitor water quality time to time. Around 40% of deaths are caused due to contaminated water in the world. Hence, there is a necessity to ensure
supply of purified drinking water for the people both in cities and villages. Water Quality Monitoring (WQM) is a cost-effective and efficient system designed to
monitor drinking water quality which makes use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. In this paper, the proposed system consists of several sensors to measure
various parameters such as pH value, the turbidity in the water, level of water in the tank, temperature and humidity of the surrounding atmosphere. And also, the
Microcontroller Unit (MCU) interfaced with these sensors and further processing is performed at Personal Computer (PC). The obtained data is sent to the cloud by
using IoT based ThinkSpeak application to monitor the quality of the water.
